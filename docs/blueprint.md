## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong indigo (#4B0082) for a sense of creativity and professionalism.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), to provide a neutral, professional backdrop that complements the design elements. This background ensures optimal contrast and readability.
- Accent color: Lilac (#C8A2C8) for interactive elements, providing a soft, modern highlight.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its clean and modern appearance. It ensures readability and complements the app's professional aesthetic.
- Use clean and minimalist icons that align with the selected design style (e.g., filled icons for modern, outline icons for minimalist).
- Utilize a grid-based layout for clear and organized content arrangement.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations to enhance the user experience (e.g., fade-in effects, smooth transitions between selections).
